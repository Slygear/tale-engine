# Tale Engine

Tale Engine is a narrative-focused RPG engine developed from scratch.

The engine is being built **entirely using ChatGPT 5.2**.
All engine architecture, systems, DSL design, and source code are generated by AI,
with a human developer directing, reviewing, testing, and committing the results.

This project intentionally explores AI as the **primary code author**, not merely as an assistant.

## What Tale Engine Is

- A from-scratch RPG engine (not based on Unity, Godot, or Unreal)
- Focused on narrative, choices, and consequences
- Uses a custom, human-readable DSL for story content
- Deterministic and validation-driven
- Desktop tooling only (no web editor)

---

## Development Model

- ChatGPT 5.2 writes the code
- The human developer:
  - defines goals
  - evaluates design decisions
  - runs and tests the code
  - performs all commits

This repository reflects an explicit human–AI development workflow.

---

## Status

Early development.

- Engine skeleton and tooling bootstrap completed
- DSL parsing and validation in progress

See `docs/engine_roadmap.txt` for planned milestones.
